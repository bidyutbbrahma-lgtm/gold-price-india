<h2>Pre-2000: The Early Years of Gold in India</h2>

<p>
India has had a long history with gold, from its role as a currency during British colonial times to its place as a cultural symbol. However, it wasn’t until post-independence that the government started focusing on gold as a financial asset and implemented key policies.
</p>

<h3>1947–1970s: The Gold Standard and Post-Independence</h3>
<p>
After India’s independence in 1947, the country’s monetary policy was largely influenced by the British colonial legacy. The gold standard, which pegged the value of currency to gold, was gradually abandoned after World War II, leading to fluctuations in gold prices.
</p>

<p>
During this period, gold was primarily viewed as a **store of value**, and most transactions were done in gold coins or jewelry. However, after 1962 (post the India-China war), the government started to introduce policy restrictions on gold imports, resulting in a limited domestic supply.
</p>

<h3>1970–1990: Increasing Demand, Gold Control Act (1962)</h3>
<p>
The **Gold Control Act** in 1962, which was enforced to curb private ownership of gold, led to the **black market** for gold. While the price of gold during this period was relatively low compared to the future, demand remained high, and gold was seen as a hedge against inflation.
</p>

<h3>1991: Economic Reforms & Liberalization</h3>
<p>
The early 1990s were a turning point for India’s economy. In 1991, India faced a severe balance of payments crisis and had to open up its economy. The government started to encourage foreign investment and relaxed gold import restrictions, paving the way for gold to enter the financial markets more openly.

<h2>2000–2009: Gold Prices Surge Amid Global Crisis</h2>

<h3>2000–2005: Steady Growth</h3>
<p>
During the early 2000s, the global price of gold increased steadily, aided by **dollar depreciation**, rising inflation, and increased demand for gold in India. In this period, the **Indian government** started embracing gold in investment portfolios.
</p>

<h3>2008–2009: Global Financial Crisis & Surge in Demand</h3>
<p>
The 2008 financial crisis created huge economic uncertainty. Central banks around the world engaged in **quantitative easing**, which led to inflationary fears. Investors flocked to gold as a **safe-haven** asset. By 2009, the price of gold had surged to over ₹12,500 per 10 grams in India.
</p>

<h2>2010–2019: Inflation, Geopolitical Tensions, and Growth</h2>

<h3>2010–2013: Peak Demand & Record Highs</h3>
<p>
In this period, gold prices hit **record highs** in India. Domestic demand surged due to high inflation rates and economic growth. The price of gold reached **₹30,000** per 10 grams by 2013. The global financial crisis’s aftermath, along with **quantitative easing** by major economies, further fueled this growth.
</p>

<h3>2014–2016: Rising Economic Tensions & Currency Depreciation</h3>
<p>
With the depreciation of the **Indian Rupee** against the US dollar, and economic uncertainties, gold prices continued their upward trend. The **Indian government** increased duties on gold imports, adding further price pressures.
</p>

<h3>2017–2019: Stabilization with Gold ETFs and Digital Gold</h3>
<p>
With the introduction of **gold ETFs** and **Sovereign Gold Bonds** in India, the accessibility of gold investment improved. While prices were still high, there was a shift from physical gold to digital formats as a result of **demonetization** and the **Goods and Services Tax (GST)**.
</p>

<h2>2020–Present: COVID-19, Global Stimulus, and Geopolitical Uncertainty</h2>

<h3>2020–2021: Record Highs During the Pandemic</h3>
<p>
The COVID-19 pandemic created a **global economic crisis**, leading to massive stimulus packages from central banks. **Gold prices soared** to over ₹50,000 per 10 grams as people turned to gold for protection from economic instability and inflation.
</p>

<h3>2022–2023: Russia-Ukraine War and Ongoing Global Tensions</h3>
<p>
Geopolitical tensions such as the **Russia-Ukraine war** and the rise in **global inflation** drove gold prices upward again. As of 2023, gold prices are at all-time highs due to continued **global uncertainties** and inflation fears.
