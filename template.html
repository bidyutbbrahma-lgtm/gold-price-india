<h2>Gold Price FAQs</h2>

<h3>What is today's gold price in India?</h3>
<p>
Today's gold price in India is determined by international gold prices, the USD to INR
exchange rate, and domestic demand. This website shows the latest updated gold price
in India for both 24K and 22K gold, refreshed daily using reliable market data.
</p>

<h3>Why does the gold price change every day in India?</h3>
<p>
Gold prices in India change daily due to fluctuations in global gold markets,
currency exchange rate movements, inflation expectations, and geopolitical events.
Since gold is traded internationally, even small changes in global markets can
impact daily gold rates in India.
</p>

<h3>Is the gold price the same across all cities in India?</h3>
<p>
Gold prices are largely similar across major Indian cities; however, small differences
may occur due to local taxes, transportation costs, and jeweller margins. As a result,
city-level gold prices may vary slightly on the same day.
</p>

<h3>What is the difference between 24K and 22K gold in India?</h3>
<p>
24K gold is 99.9 percent pure gold and is mainly used for investment purposes such as
gold coins and bars. 22K gold contains a small percentage of other metals for added
strength and durability, making it more suitable for jewellery.
</p>

<h3>Is gold a good investment in India?</h3>
<p>
Gold is widely regarded as a long-term store of value in India and is often used as
a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations. Investors commonly track daily
gold prices before investing in physical gold, gold ETFs, or sovereign gold bonds.
